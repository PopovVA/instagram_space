# instagram_space

Pjocets was created for demonstrate how working Hubble API, SpaceX API, Instagram API.

## How it works

1. Python3 should be already installed. Then use ```pip``` (or ```pip3```, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Environment keys should be in ```.env``` file, he should contains two variable 
```
LOGIN=your_login_from_instagram
PASSWORD=your_login_from_instagram
```

3. Now we can run the code
```
$ python3 main.py
```

## Project goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org).
